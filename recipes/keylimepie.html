<h3>Description</h3>

<p>There's nothing like a classic Key lime pie to satisfy your sweet tooth. This sweet, rich, creamy, and tangy Key lime pie recipe is easy to make on a whim with just five easy-to-find ingredients.</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li> Sweetened condensed milk: This sweet, smooth, and creamy Key lime pie starts with a can of sweetened condensed milk.</li>
    <li>Key lime juice: Key lime juice comes from the Florida Keys. Key limes are more acidic than regular limes, so they pack a flavorful punch.</li>
    <li>Sour cream: Sour cream contributes to the rich texture and lends subtly tangy flavor.</li>
    <li>Lime zest: A tablespoon of lime zest enhances the bold citrusy flavor.</li>
    <li>Graham cracker crust: Use a store-bought or homemade graham cracker crust.

    </li>

</ul>

<ol>

    <li> The filling: Combine the filling ingredients in a bowl and mix well. Pour into the prepared graham cracker crust.</li>
    <li>Bake the pie: Bake the pie in a preheated oven until tiny bubbles appear and pop on the surface of the pie.</li>
    <li>Cool the pie: Allow the pie to cool on a wire rack, then transfer it to the refrigerator to finish setting. Top with whipped cream and lime wedges, if desired.</li>
</ol>
